# Outward-facing features
- [ ] Stat-gathering and quantified viewing - *1 day*
    - [ ] Fire IDs
    - [ ] Intermittent polls of the current frame with statistics gathering
    - [ ] Chart and graph viewers
- [ ] Optimizations - *2 days*
    - [ ] Different passes with different frequencies. i.e. fire could be simulated with a hire resolution than (the much slower) tree growth
- [ ] More realistic burning - *1 day*
    - [ ] Temp map
    - [ ] Spontaneous ignition when hot and fire spreading
- [ ] More realistic trees (**significant - we need a tree OVERHAUL**) - *about 10 days*
    - [ ] Various tree types with different: *1 week*
        - Fire properties
        - Growth rates
        - Germination rates
        - Lifespans
        - Underbrush properties
        - Interactions with other trees (not implemented at all yet)
    - [ ] More realistic tree growth and death *1 day*
        - [ ] Probabilistic germination and then gradual growth
        - [ ] Death probability by time, possibly a health metric
    - [ ] Interaction between trees *2 days*
        - [ ] Fire resistence by tree communication (it's a real thing!!!)
        - [ ] Tree crowding
        - [ ] Cross species interaction (once that's implemented)
- [ ] UI overhaul (lower priority, it's just gonna get worse while the rest is implemented) *1 week*
    - [ ] Use of space
    - [ ] More intuitive parameters, possibly some hover tooltips or more details always shown
    - [ ] An introduction and compatibility check
    - [ ] Performance information
    - [ ] Fast forwards and control over how fast more easily

Total: About three weeks
# Dev QOL features
- [ ] Single source of truth for parameters *1 day*
